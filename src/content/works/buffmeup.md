This was my “first step” into the **full-stack** world, and it was also my **final project** for **Softuni**!

Made all the way back in 2023, _BuffMeUp_ tried to copy _MyFitnessPal_, but with additional functionality for tracking workouts

This was my first time ever making a fully functional **web app** with a separate **front end**, **backend** and **database**. And I don’t even think that I knew about Tailwind yet lol

## Technologies used:

*   **React**
    
*   **ASP.NET Core**
    
*   **Entity Framework Core**
    
*   **SQL Server**
