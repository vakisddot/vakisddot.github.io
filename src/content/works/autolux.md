Yet another Astro static site, this time made as a course project for my university.

I didn’t have to go this hard for a simple course project (we were supposed to just use plain html btw), but I just really wanted to experiment more with Astro.

It also has a “3D” page that is just a Three.js scene and some car models. Still, it makes it stand out more imo ;)

Another cool thing is that the “collection” of cars is over 1000! They’re all from a dataset (credited in the GitHub repo), and the images are dynamically fetched through Wikipedia’s api when the “fetch-images” script is called.
