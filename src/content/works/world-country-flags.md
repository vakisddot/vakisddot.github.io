With about 10k downloads, this Terraria mod is the most popular software that I’ve personally made (so far), and honestly it’s nothing too crazy, it doesn’t use any crazy algorithms, drawing the flags themselves was more work than the programming.

Fun fact: This mod is also pretty controversial, as it attracted a lot of international players who sometimes might not agree upon what counts as a country and what doesn’t (uh oh)
