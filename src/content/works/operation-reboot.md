This is probably my biggest project so far - an app that is all about fighting addictions!

The basic idea is that for each “relapse”, you have to complete a set of challenges to build discipline and to teach your brain that relapsing will be punished.

I personally thought of this as a great idea for an app and something that was not really available anywhere else on the market. However, my marketing strategy was off, and I guess that making the app paid was not the greatest of ideas.

This is also my most vibe-coded app, and this was the app that taught me that vibe-coding is probably not the future as most people make it out to be.

Despite the fact that I managed to build this with AI in about a week in the summer of 2025, the codebase was in a horrific state and required a lot of refactoring in the end. And to this day, I’d say that this app would’ve been way better if I hadn’t used so much AI while making it.

The app has a very loyal user base of about ~5 of my close friends and family 🙂
